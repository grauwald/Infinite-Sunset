## Description
Infinite Sunset is a continuation of the piece Sunset which I created after visiting Kauai and staring at the Pacific quite a bit around sunset.  It intentionally uses simple graphical elements to visually describe a sunset seascape ever changing in its sameness.  The piece is meant to be viewed with various devices/contexts and is therefore a "responsive" composition. Ideally the piece is meant to run continuously, projected at a large scale, for long periods of time. 

Infinite Sunset is written in Processing and ports well to processing.js and/or Android as it uses only core functions that are available across those variants.  

In the context of Google's DevArt project I will integrate the Google Search API to find images of sunsets to discover color pallettes for the various compositional elements.  These color pallettes
