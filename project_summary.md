## Description
Infinite Sunset is a continuation of the piece Sunset which I created after visiting Kauai and staring at the Pacific quite a bit around sunset.  It intentionally uses simple graphical elements to visually describe a sunset seascape ever changing in its sameness.  The piece is meant to be viewed with various devices/contexts and is therefore a "responsive" composition. Ideally the piece is meant to run continuously, projected at a large scale, for long periods of time. 

Infinite Sunset is written in Processing and ports well to processing.js and/or Android as it uses only core functions that are available across those variants.  

In the context of Google's DevArt project I will integrate the Google Search API to find images of sunsets to discover color pallettes for the various compositional elements.  These color pallettes will be generated and applied when the application begins and at various times during its progress.
