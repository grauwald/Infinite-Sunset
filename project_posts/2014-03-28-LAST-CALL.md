Ok, rushing to get this in.

Turns out processing.js cross-domain for images is lame.   Eventually I could create a proxy to load images off the local server.  

Desktop is looking glorious.  Loading images, grabbing their colors and rendering out an infinite sunset.

For the web version I'm just using a static set of colors derived from the desktop version.
